INTRODUCTION.
</H3>

<P>
The object of this little work is to present in a compact form and
systematic order a complete list of all the most useful and important
workings connected with Cordage, and a lucid explanation of their
various formations.
</P>

<P>
The explanations of some of the elementary knots have been gone into
with what a practical seaman of even short experience may consider
almost unnecessary minuteness, but the aim throughout has been to
render the work of value to those who approach the subject for the
first time.
</P>

<P>
To attain this end, diagrams are introduced at every stage, and if
followed closely step by step, in conjunction with the text referring
to them, the learner should have no difficulty in following their
construction.
</P>

<P>
At the same time he must remember that proficiency in what is really
skilled workmanship, amounting almost to an art, can only be gained by
much practice and perseverance, and should gladly avail himself of any
advice or help he may be able to obtain from his more experienced
ship-mates.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF ROPES.
</H3>

<P>
Rope, the term being used in its widest construction, is made from
almost every pliable material, but is generally composed of hemp,
manila, coir, cotton, steel, iron, or copper wire.
</P>

<P>
For the present we will confine ourselves to those having their origin
in the vegetable kingdom, and more especially to those made from hemp
and manila.
</P>

<P>
These are divided into three classes:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
(1).  <B>A Hawser-laid Rope</B>, which is composed of three strands laid up
generally right-handed (that is, the direction taken by the strands in
forming the rope runs always from left to right) (Fig. 1.)
</P>

<P>
(2).  <B>A Shroud-laid Rope</B>, also laid up right-handed, but consisting
of four strands (Fig. 2) with a heart in the centre.
</P>

<P>
(3).  <B>A Cable-laid Rope</B>, which is composed of three right-handed
hawser-laid ropes laid up together left-handed, so that it may be said
to consist of nine strands (Fig. 3), or it may be formed by three
left-handed ropes laid up right-handed (Fig. 4).
</P>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P2"></A>2}</SPAN>

<A NAME="img-fig001"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG CLASS="imgcenter" SRC="images/img-fig001.jpg" ALT="Fig. 1.  Fig. 2.  Fig. 3." BORDER="0" WIDTH="511" HEIGHT="327">
</CENTER>

<P>
In Fig. 4 we show a more complete analysis of its construction (in this
case a right-handed cable-laid rope).
</P>

<A NAME="img-fig004"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG CLASS="imgcenter" SRC="images/img-fig004.jpg" ALT="Fig. 4." BORDER="0" WIDTH="349" HEIGHT="340">
</CENTER>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P3"></A>3}</SPAN>

<P>
First we see the cable <I>e</I> formed by the three ropes <I>d</I>, <I>f</I>, and <I>g</I>;
whilst the rope <I>g</I> is dissected to show the strands forming it, <I>c</I>,
<I>h</I>, <I>j</I>; and in the strand <I>h</I> we see <I>b</I>, the yarn composing the
strand, and <I>a</I> a yarn teased out to show the original fibre.
</P>

<P>
The end of a rope must always be secured in some way, or it is evident
from its construction that it will on the slightest usage become frayed
out.  The commonest method is by placing on an ordinary whipping, which
is done as follows:&mdash;First lay the end of a length of twine along the
end of the rope, and then commencing at the part furthest from the
rope's end take a half dozen or more turns around both the rope and
twine end (Fig. 5).  Then lay the twine in the form of a loop along the
rope and over the turns already taken, as in Fig. 6.  To finish off
take that portion of the loop designated <I>a</I>, and continue taking turns
tightly round the rope and part <I>b</I> of the twine until the loop is
nearly all used up; pull through the remainder snugly by part <I>c</I>, and
cut off short when, no end of twine will be visible as in Fig. 7.
</P>

<A NAME="img-fig005"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG CLASS="imgcenter" SRC="images/img-fig005.jpg" ALT="Fig. 5.  Fig. 6.  Fig. 7." BORDER="0" WIDTH="491" HEIGHT="242">
</CENTER>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P4"></A>4}</SPAN>

<P>
Considering that we now have at our disposal a small sized rope with
the end whipped, we will at once proceed to the formation of the most
elementary knots and hitches, namely, those formed by a single rope's
end.
</P>

<P>
Fig. 8 shows a common loop, by which most of the following knots, etc.,
are commenced.  Note exactly how the loop lies, and let us letter its
parts clearly for future reference.  The part of rope extending from 1
to 2 is known as the standing part which we will call <I>a</I>, the portion
included between 2 and 3 following round the loop by <I>y</I> and <I>z</I> is
termed the bight which we will call <I>b</I>, and from 3 to 4 is known as
the end <I>e</I>.
</P>

Note that the round turn in (Fig. 26) is taken round both the standing
part <I>a</I> and the larger rope.  The great value of this hitch is its
non-liability to slip in the direction <I>B</I> (Fig. 27).  If, however,
owing to an extremely severe strain or other causes the hitch is
inclined to slip, the end <I>e</I> should be backed round part <I>d</I> of the
first rope, that is, twisted around it in long lays in the opposite
direction to that in which the hitch was formed, and the end secured by
a stop (Fig. 28).

(12).  A Timber Hitch is a useful way of securing a rope quickly to a
plank, but when there is to be a long and continuous strain, or when it
is required to keep the end of a piece of timber pointed steadily in
one direction, it should be supplemented with a half hitch (Figs. 29,

The timber hitch itself consists simply of a half hitch taken with a
rather long end, which is used up by twisting it back around its own
part of the hitch.  In Fig. 29 the hitch is purposely left very loose
so that its formation may be the more easily seen.

hitch

<P>
To form it on a rope by its own strands, unlay the rope to the place
where it is desired to form the knot, and as after the knot is made the
strands will have to be laid up again, try to preserve the original lay
in the strands as much as possible.  Now bring each of the three
strands down alongside the standing part of the rope, thus forming
three bights, and hold them thus with the left hand.  Take the first
strand <I>a</I> (Fig. 73) and, putting it over the next, <I>b</I>, bring it up
through the bight of the third strand <I>c</I>.

This would appear too confusing if shown in a diagram, but the knot is

Now lay any opposite two of the strands across the top

SPLICES.

the desired size.  Lay the three strands upon the standing part, now
tuck the middle strand through the strand of the standing part of the
rope next to it (against the lay of the rope), then pass the strand on
the left over the strand under which No. 1 strand is tucked, and tuck
it under the next, and lastly, put the remaining strand through the
third strand on the other side of the rope (Fig. 82.)

If the strands are tucked with the lay of the rope it is termed a

WIRE SPLICING.
</H3>

<P>
In splicing wire, great care should be taken to prevent kinks getting
in the rope or strands.
</P>

<P>
With steel wire, always before working it, put a stop on at the place
to which you intend to unlay, and also put a good whipping of twine at
the end of each strand.
</P>

<P>
Steel wire is six-stranded right-handed, and has a heart of hemp.
Flexible wire has a heart of hemp in each strand.
</P>

<P>
Crucible wire is made in the same manner, except that the strands are
wire throughout.
</P>

<P>
Crucible wire is used for standing rigging and flexible wire for
purchases, etc.
</P>

<P>
In splicing wire all tucks are made with the lay of the rope.
</P>

<P>
In making an eye splice the rope is handled better if hung up in a
convenient position so that when standing up the eye will be at about
the level of the chest of the person working.
</P>

<P>
A long tapering steel marline-spike is required, and after placing it
under a strand do not withdraw it until the tuck is made and all the
slack of the strand drawn through.
</P>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P48"></A>48}</SPAN>

<P>
There are several methods in vogue for tucking the strand, but the
following is as good as any:&mdash;Tuck the first strand under two strands
and all the rest under one strand respectively.  Tuck whole again, and
this time each strand under one strand, then halve the strands and tuck
again.
</P>

<P>
To make a neat splice do not haul the part of the rope that has not
been unlaid too close to the neck of the splice, and in tucking the
strands never take a short nip but take long lays.
</P>

<P>
In unlaying for a long splice, always unlay two strands simultaneously,
to keep the rope in its original lay.  For a fair-sized rope unlay
about 9 ft. of each end.
</P>

<P>
Proceed as in rope splicing, and after the three pairs of strands are
in their places, single them, and continue to unlay and lay-in until
the six meeting places of the strands are equi-distant.
</P>

<P>
To finish off the ends properly can only be learnt by observation and
actual practice.  By using two marline-spikes, the hempen heart is
removed and the ends of the wire strands forced into the place it
occupied, making a very neat job when finished.
</P>

<P>
Wire splices should be parcelled with oily canvas and served with
Hambro' line.

MISCELLANEOUS ODDS AND ENDS.
</H3>

<P>
(1).  <B>A Palm and Needle Whipping</B> is a more permanent way of securing
a rope's end from fraying than the common whipping put on by hand.
First, place the needle under one of the strands and draw nearly the
whole length of twine through.  Take a considerable number of turns
round the rope with the twine, drawing each well taut in turn, and
finish up by following round with the needle between each strand,
forming a series of frappings, and cut off the end of the twine short
(Fig. 105).

</CENTER>

<P>
(2).  <B>A West Country Whipping</B> is formed by middling the twine around
the part of the rope to be marked and half knotting it at every half
turn, so that each half knot will be on opposite sides.  When a
sufficient number of turns are passed, finish it off with a reef knot.
</P>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P57"></A>57}</SPAN>

<P>
(3).  <B>An American Whipping</B> is sometimes used for the ends of hawsers.
It is commenced in the same way as a common whipping, but finished off
by having both ends out in the middle of the whipping and forming a
reef knot.  This is done by leaving the first end out when you commence
to pass the turns on the bight over the last end.
</P>

<P>
(4).  <B>To Point a Rope End</B>.&mdash;First put a stop on at twice and a half
the circumference of the rope from the end, which will leave about the
length for pointing, unlay the rope to the stop and then unlay the
strands.  Split a number of the outside yarns and make a nettle out of
each yarn.  (A nettle is made by laying up the yarns with the finger
and thumb left-handed.)  When the nettles are made stop them back on
the standing part of the rope; then form the point with the rest of the
yarns by scraping them down to a proper size with a knife, and marl
them down together with twine; divide the nettles, taking every other
one up and every other one down.  Pass three turns with a piece of
twine&mdash;which is called the warp&mdash;very taut round the part where the
nettles separate, taking a hitch with the last turn.  Continue to
repeat this process by placing every alternate nettle up and down,
passing the warp or "filling," taking a hitch each time, until the
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P58"></A>58}</SPAN>

point is to its required length.  It is generally finished off by
working a small Flemish eye in the end (Figs. 106 and 107).

(5).  <B>Turk's Head</B>.&mdash;The Turk's Head is one of the most common of the
ornamental knots used at sea, and is formed from an ordinary clove
hitch (Fig. 108) made sufficiently slack to allow for the working of
the other parts.
</P>

Having formed the clove hitch, pass <I>b</I> over <I>c</I> and tuck <I>a</I> under and
up through the bight formed by <I>c</I> as in Fig. 109.  It will then be
found that there is another twist in
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P60"></A>60}</SPAN>

over <I>c</I> again and tuck <I>a</I> as before.  The number of crossings
required depends principally on the size of the material on which the
Turk's Head is formed.  To finish off as in Fig. 110, the part <I>a</I> is
made to follow <I>d</I> (Fig 108) round for three times.

hoist by an eye splice; a length of rope equal to the width of the flag
left below the hoist, as this is the distance the flags should be
apart, and then a running eye splice made so as to be rapidly attached

</P>

<P>
(9).  <B>To Stick a Cringle</B>.&mdash;First unlay a single strand from
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P62"></A>62}</SPAN>
the
size of rope your cringle is required to be, whip both ends, reeve the
strand through the left hand eyelet hole in the sail, having one end
longer than the other&mdash;nearly a third&mdash;keeping the roping of the sail
towards you.  If a thimble is to be put in the cringle, lay up the
parts of the strand together, counting three lays; commence with the
short end of the strand towards you, then reeve the long strand from
you through the right hand eyelet hole, taking it through the cringle,
and it will be in the right position to lay up in the vacant space left
in the cringle; when done, the one end will hang down inside the right
hand eyelet hole and the other end outside the left hand one; the ends
are then hitched by being rove through their respective eyelet holes
and passed over the leech rope and under their own part, one hitch
being towards you and the other from you; then take the ends down under
one strand on the right and two on the left of cringle nearest to it;
then tuck the ends under the first two strands nearest the hitch,
heaving them well in place; the cringle is then fidded out, and the
thimble is put in on the fore part of the sail.  The ends of the strand
are then tucked back, left-handed, under one strand, again under two,
right-handed, as in the first place, heaving them taut in place
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P63"></A>63}</SPAN>
at
each tuck, the ends are then whipped with two of their own yarns and
cut off.  If a large cringle is needed, count an extra number of
lays&mdash;5, 7, etc., always an odd number.
</P>

<P>
(10).  <B>To Finish a Cringle off on the Crown</B>.&mdash;Commence as before, but
after laying up the strand, instead of forming a hitch with each end,
the ends are rove through their respective eyelet holes and tucked back
under two strands of the cringles and again laid up as far as the
crown, forming a four-stranded cringle, and finished off by tucking the
ends under two strands and crossing them under the crown of the cringle
and cut close off.

necessary to give a sail one cloth more spread, it would then be
necessary to lengthen the head and foot rope.  Supposing the width of
cloth to be 2 feet and the size of the rope 3 in.  After ripping the
rope off four cloths, first of all cut the strand at the distance 2 ft.

rigged, as the loops form a means of attaching the necessary supports
to the mast.  The centre <I>k</I> (Fig. 120) is slipped over the masthead,
and the weight brought on the stays tightens it and holds it in its
position on the mast.

HOW TO HANDLE WIRE ROPE, ETC.
</H3>

<P>
<B>The following article by a Wire Specialist will be read with
interest</B>:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
When uncoiling Wire Rope it is important that no kinks are allowed to
form, as once a kink is made no amount of strain can take it out, and
the rope is unsafe to work.  If possible a turn-table should be
employed (an old cart wheel mounted on a spindle makes an excellent
one); the rope will then lead off perfectly straight without kinks.
(See Fig. 129.)
</P>

<A NAME="img-fig129"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG CLASS="imgcenter" SRC="images/img-fig129.jpg" ALT="Fig. 129.  Fig. 130." BORDER="0" WIDTH="451" HEIGHT="294">
</CENTER>

<P>
If a turn-table is not available the rope may be rolled along the
ground as shown in Fig. 130.
</P>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P73"></A>73}</SPAN>

<P>
In no case must the rope be laid on the ground and the end taken over
(as in Fig. 131), or kinks will result, and the rope will be completely
spoiled.
</P>

<A NAME="img-fig131"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG CLASS="imgcenter" SRC="images/img-fig131.jpg" ALT="Fig. 131." BORDER="0" WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="297">
</CENTER>

<P>
The life of Wire Rope depends principally upon the diameter of drums,
sheaves, and pulleys; and too much importance cannot be given to the
size of the latter.  Wherever possible the size of the pulleys should
be not less than 700 times the diameter of the largest wire in the
rope, and never less than 300 times.  The diameters of drums, sheaves,
and pulleys should increase with the working load when the factor of
safety is less than 5 to 1.
</P>

<P>
The load should not be lifted with a jerk, as the strain may equal
three or four times the proper load, and a sound rope may easily be
broken.
</P>

<P>
Examine ropes frequently.  A new rope is cheaper than the risk of
killing or maiming employees.
</P>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P74"></A>74}</SPAN>

<P>
One-fifth of the ultimate strength of the rope should be considered a
fair working load.
</P>

<P>
In shafts and elevators where human life is constantly raised and
lowered, the working load should not be more than one-tenth of the
ultimate breaking strength of the rope.
</P>

<P>
To increase the amount of work done, it is better to increase the
working load than the speed of the rope.  Experience has shown that the
wear of the rope increases with the speed.
</P>

<P>
Wire Rope should be greased when running or idle.  Rust destroys as
effectively as hard work.
</P>

<P>
Galvanized Wire Rope should never be used for running rope.  One day's
use will wear off the coating of zinc, and the rope will soon begin to
rust.
</P>

<P>
Great care should be taken that the grooves of drums and sheaves are
perfectly smooth, ample in diameter, and conformed to the surface of
the rope.  They should also be in perfect line with the rope, so that
the latter may not chafe on the sides of the grooves.

Directions for Splicing.
</H4>

<P>
TO MAKE AN ENDLESS SPLICE.&mdash;Clamps are applied to the rope sufficiently
far back from the ends to allow plenty of room for the splice, and the
men to operate in.  The two ends are then drawn together by means of
blocks and tackle, until they overlap each other for a space of twenty
to thirty feet, according to the size of the rope.  At a point from
each end midway of the lap, the rope must be bound with a good serving
of No. 18 or No. 20 annealed wire.  The serving at the extreme ends is
then cut off, the strands untwisted to the new serving, and the hemp
cores also cut off so as to abut when the open bunches of strands are
brought together, and the opposite strands interlaced regularly with
each other, presenting the appearance as near as can be shown (Fig.
133).
</P>

<A NAME="img-fig133"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG CLASS="imgcenter" SRC="images/img-fig133.jpg" ALT="Fig. 133." BORDER="0" WIDTH="433" HEIGHT="285">
</CENTER>

<P>
After these are all correctly interlaced, pull the ropes tightly
together, so that the cores abut against one another.  Next take
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P77"></A>77}</SPAN>
strand No. 1, and as it is being unlaid, follow it up with strand A,
which must be laid into its place tightly until within five feet from
the end.  Strand No. 1 is then cut off, leaving it five feet long, same
length as A strand.  The remaining strands are treated the same way,
three alternate strands being laid towards the right hand and three to
the left.  The strands being now all laid in their places, the ends are
cut off, as with the first strands, to five feet.  The appearance of
splice will now be the same as in Fig. 134.
</P>

<A NAME="img-fig134"></A>
<CENTER>
<IMG CLASS="imgcenter" SRC="images/img-fig134.jpg" ALT="Fig. 134." BORDER="0" WIDTH="523" HEIGHT="122">
</CENTER>

<P>
The next thing is to tuck in the ends, and this is where the skill
comes in.  Before doing this, <I>care should be observed to see that the
spliced portion of the rope is perfectly limp, or free of tension,
otherwise this operation cannot be well performed</I>.  The core is then
cut and pulled out on the side corresponding with the end to be tucked
in for a distance equal to the length of the end which is to replace
it.  It is desirable, especially if the rope is composed of small
wires, to tie the ends of the strands with soft twine or threads of
jute yarn in order to keep the wires well bunched.  A marlin spike is
then passed over <B>1</B> and under two of the strands, when the core is cut
off at the proper point, and by moving the spike along the rope
spirally with the strands, the loose end <B>1</B> is passed into the core
space and the spike withdrawn.
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P78"></A>78}</SPAN>
Then pull out the core on the
other side, pass the marlin spike over A and under two strands as
before, cut off the core, and tuck in the end A in precisely the same
manner, after which the rope is twisted back again as tightly as
possible, and the clamps or other appliances that may be used are
removed to the next pair of projecting ends.  Any slight inequality in
the symmetrical shape of the rope may be taken out by pounding with a
wooden mallet.  Some prefer to tuck in first all the ends projecting in
one direction, and then the ends projecting the other way; it is
immaterial in what order they are tucked in.

If these directions are implicitly followed, the spliced portion of the
rope will be of uniform diameter with other portions, and will present
a smooth and even appearance throughout.  After running a day or two,
the locality of the splice cannot be readily detected, and the rope
will be quite as strong in this portion as any other.

Splicing Thimbles.

<P>
UNDER AND OVER STYLE&mdash;Ordinary type of Wire Rope.  Serve the rope with
wire or tarred yarn to suit the circumference of the thimble, bend
round thimble and tie securely in place with temporary lashing till
splice is finished (as in Fig. 135).  Open out the strands (as in Fig.
136), taking care to keep the loose end of the rope to the left hand
(see Fig. 136).  Now insert marlin spike, lifting two strands (as shown
in Fig. 137), and tuck away towards the right hand (that is inserting
the strand at the point, and over the spike) strand No. 1, pulling the
strand well home.  Next
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P80"></A>80}</SPAN>
insert marlin spike through next strand to
the left, only lifting one strand, the point of the spike coming out at
the same place as before.  Tuck away strand No. 2 as before.
</P>

<P>
The next tuck is the locking tuck.  Insert marlin spike in next strand,
and, missing No. 3, tuck away strand No. 4 from the point of the spike
towards the right hand.  Now, without taking out the spike, tuck away
strand No. 3 behind the spike towards the left hand (as shown in Fig.
138).  Now insert spike in next strand, and tuck away strand No. 5
behind and over the spike.  No. 6 likewise.  Pull all the loose strands
well down.

<P>
This completes the first series of tucks, and the splice will, if made
properly, be as Fig. 139.  Now, starting with strand No. 1 and taking
each strand in rotation, tuck away under one strand and over the next
strand till all the strands have been tucked four times.  If
<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P81"></A>81}</SPAN>
it is
intended to taper the splice, the strands may at this point be split,
and half of the wires being tucked away as before, the other half cut
close to the splice.  Fig. 127 [Transcriber's note: 140?] shows the
finished splice ready for serving over.
</P>

<SPAN CLASS="pagenum">{<A NAME="P82"></A>82}</SPAN>

<P>
It will be noticed that this style of splice possesses a plaited
appearance, and the more strain applied to the rope, the tighter the
splice will grip, and there is no fear of the splice drawing owing to
rotation of the rope.
</P>

<P>
LIVERPOOL OR SPIRAL STYLE (See Fig. 141).&mdash;Hawsers, or any ropes not
hanging free and liable to spin, may be spliced in this style, in which
the strands, instead of being interlocked together, are merely tucked
round and round one particular strand in the rope.  Each loose strand
is of course tucked round a different strand in the rope.  This is
sometimes called the "Liverpool" style (See Fig. 141).
